# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Hardened release digest replay by separating replay source-commit/source-ref
  validation from current-checkout validation, centralizing role digest-mode
  policy, rejecting artifact paths that escape the replay root, and adding CI
  schema-export drift checks. Replay findings now report generic `expected` and
  `actual` values because findings may compare digests, commits, refs, or path
  state.
- Expanded public review artifacts: measurement use-case brief,
  executive one-pager, citable abstracts, technical report, reproducibility
  appendix, OpenTelemetry gap analysis, deferred contribution candidate,
  standards freshness checklist, and traceability coverage for those public
  claims.
- Added CI orchestration over candidate RunSets with optional baseline
  comparison, full/fail-fast report modes, structured diagnostics, evidence
  packet generation, Markdown packets, environment provenance, local dependency
  inventory generation, release artifact manifests, replay-stable release
  digest checks, and keyless cosign signing/verification workflow support for
  exact release evidence blobs.
- Hardened post-review contracts: RunSets now bind suite version/digest and
  fixture manifest digest, evidence records include explicit claim-evidence
  links, provider expectation failures emit `FORBIDDEN_PROVIDER`, comparison
  diffs use stable finding identity instead of message text, decimal digest
  projection uses fixed six-place strings, SafeError carries non-leaking debug
  metadata, runset writes redact summaries before persistence, and report/span
  output is privacy-filtered before display.
- Added the initial implementation: package skeleton, strict schemas, schema
  export, validator parity, YAML compilation, canonical digests, privacy
  utilities, HMAC tokens, and OpenTelemetry-aligned span-plan preview.
- Added fixture manifests, safe fixture path resolution, compiled-suite loading,
  golden drift checks, deterministic fixture runs, and the synthetic prior
  authorization example variants.
- Hardened fixture runs with typed variant configs, explicit case-to-expectation
  links, multi-root fixture validation, source digest checks, and catalog-based
  prior authorization evidence assembly.
- Reworked the prior authorization evidence regression to arise from duplicate
  source/content associations during catalog reconstruction, modeled provider
  selection as layered configuration precedence, added a fake-PHI redaction
  fixture case, and enabled socket-disabled pytest runs.
- Expanded the prior authorization evidence fixtures to cover nine ordinary
  one-source/one-claim cases plus the shared-source edge case, added a
  blind-review release-evidence rubric, and added a minimal expense-approval
  example with baseline and provider-control candidate variants.
- Moved bundled example subject logic under an explicit package examples
  namespace, merged duplicate evidence references before persistence, and
  removed unused split-case YAML placeholders.
- Kept bundled example modules installable for reproducibility while documenting
  that they are not a stable public extension API, and moved the intentionally
  lossy evidence assembly behavior out of shared framework evidence helpers.
- Added deterministic RunSet evaluation with expectation resolution, material
  evidence-link invariants, structured output and configured tool controls,
  provider review-boundary and human-review controls, gate profiles, disjoint
  case metrics, per-finding time-bounded waivers, not-evaluated capability
  reporting, and JSON/Markdown/Rich evaluation reports.
- Added RunSet comparison with fixture-equivalence gating, final comparison
  classifications, provenance-only diffing, candidate-first JSON/Markdown/Rich
  reports, and invalid-comparison exit behavior.
- Added a public flagship showcase with exact local commands, expected
  pass/fail output fields, baseline-to-candidate comparison story, GitHub
  Actions usage snippet, and reproducibility digest summary.
